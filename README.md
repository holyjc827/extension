# Chrome Simple Break reminder

This is a Chrome extension which allows the user to get a notification for a short break. 
The user can either choose a pre-set time (10 min, 30 min, 1 hour) or set up a customized time. 

Even if the extension pop up is closed, the timer will go on. Once the time is up, the user will get a desktop notification.

This extension was built with Chrome Extensions API, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
